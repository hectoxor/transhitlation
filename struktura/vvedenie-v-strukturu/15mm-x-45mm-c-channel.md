The[ C Channel](https://www.revrobotics.com/competition/ftc/structure/channel/) uses a combination of a **fixed pitch system** and an **extrusion system** to make it easy to iterate robot designs. The Channel system overall is compatible with standard [M3 hardware](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/hardware/fasteners/) , and is designed to work seamlessly with existing[ 15mm Extrusion](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/structure/15mm-extrusion/) and [15mm x 30mm Extrusion](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/structure/15mm-extrusion/). The extrusion system has slots that allows flexible bracket positions for easy Channel to Extrusion connection.&#x20;

The 45mm wide side of the channel features the **Extended Motion Pattern** which uses M3 hardware for attaching brackets, extrusion, and channel together. Locations for mounting bearings, shafts, motors, and servos are available every 16mm. Slots on the 15mm sections of the channel accept standard M3 hex-head bolts or nuts, rather than expensive t-nuts.&#x20;

### Product Specifications&#x20;

* Material: 6063 aluminum
* Height: 45mm
* Width: 15mm
* Length: [Various lengths ](https://www.revrobotics.com/competition/ftc/structure/channel/)
  * Channel can be cut to length if necessary, but care should be taken to ensure cuts preserve the necessary portions of the motion pattern for the overall robot design

### When to Use?

The C Channels are great for creating a sturdy [robot drivetrain](broken-reference) or for use in areas where additional **torsional strength** is needed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Torsional Strength** is a measure of the ability of a material to withstand a twisting load.&#x20;

_To learn more about why torsional strength is helpful to your robot design visit the_ [_constraining motion_](broken-reference) _page_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### How to Use?

The combination of the pitch and extrusion systems featured on the C channel allows flexibility in design and iterations. The extended motion pattern featured on the 15mm x 45mm C Channel allows for easy placement of moving parts, for addition constraint and support of motion. The extended motion pattern can also allow easier replacement or swapping of parts on interior portions of the robot than the 15mm Extrusion, depending on robot design.
