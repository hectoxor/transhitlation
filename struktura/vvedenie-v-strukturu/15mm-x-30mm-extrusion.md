# 15mm x 30mm Extrusion

The 15mm x 30mm profile of the [Extrusion](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/structure/15mm-extrusion/) has slots on on all four sides that accept standard [M3 hardware](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/hardware/fasteners/). Rather than using a T-nut, which is more expensive, slide a M3 hex head screw along the slot and adjust brackets and other build materials as needed. As illustrated in the image above, the ends of the Extrusion also have a 5mm hole **pitch** that can be M3 tappped. The 15mm x 30mm Extrusion has one slot on each 15mm face and 3 slots on each 30mm face, allowing for some additional design flexibility when compared to the standard 15mm extrusion.

### Product Specs

* Material: 6063 aluminum, clear or black anodized
* Height: 15mm
* Width: 30mm
* Length: 1m or 420mm
  * Extrusion can be cut to shorter lengths as needed

### When to Use?

The 15mm x 30mm Extrusion is great for areas where more torsional strength is needed in an application than the standard 15mm Extrusion.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Torsional Strength** is a measure of the ability of a material to withstand a twisting load.

_To learn more about why torsional strength is helpful to your robot design visit the_ [_constraining motion_](broken-reference) _page_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### How to Use?

The point of the extrusion system is to offer more flexibility in design than would come in a fixed pitch system. The slots in the extrusion allow brackets and other components to be slid along the 15mm Extrusion to an infinite number of positions.&#x20;
